# arras-template-completed2: A Server Template
*Still made by Penta (0101) and FrozenEarth*

## This is a backup of arras-template-completed.
So for some reason arras-template-completed got borked somehow, and it's broken.

Thankfully, I remixed a backup of it just in case anything happened to it.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Click the top right where it says **Remix to Edit ðŸŽ¤**
2. Give your new project a name.
3. Your private server name will be at <http://arras.io/#host=arras-template.glitch.me> (replace `arras-template` with its new name)
  This link is <http://arras.io/#host=trap-guard.glitch.me>

## Setting your Server Token

1. Open the file at the left named `ðŸ”‘.env`
2. These variables represent your server tokens.
3. You may input a key by going to <http://arras.io/#host=arras-template.glitch.me&key=aSecretPasswordHere> (replace `aSecretPasswordHere` with the password)

# File Directory
- The map/config data are in the `config.js` file
- The tank, bullet, and all entity data are in the `lib/definitions.js` file.
- Other stuff (score curve, stat amount) are in the `server.js` file
